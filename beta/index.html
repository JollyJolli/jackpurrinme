			<h2>About Me!</h2>
			<p>This website was made by a nerdy person who was just bored. I'm just an ordinary gamer. Loves cats, and older stuff. I love to repurpose old tech and try to make it usable today.</p>
			<p>I don't currently have a job, still a high school student. I do know that I want to do Cybersecurity or be a Software Engineer when I'm able to get a job though. My dream school is MIT, and ASU, and I have intentions to get lots and lots of certifications.</p>
			<strong><p>Don't hack, dox, or harass people who you don't like. It's not nice.</p></strong>
